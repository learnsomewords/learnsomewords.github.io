About 1 in 54 children has been identified with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) according to estimates from CDC’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. 

ASD is more than 4 times more common among boys than among girls.

The term "refrigerator mother" was coined by Austrian psychiatrist Leo Kanner in the 1940s to describe a mother whose cold, uncaring style so traumatized her child that they retreated into autism.

Research shows that early diagnosis of and interventions for autism are more likely to have major long-term positive effects on symptoms and later skills.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can sometimes be diagnosed in children before they are 2 years of age.

1949 - Kanner - Kanner proclaims his theory that autism is caused by "refrigerator mothers," a term used to describe parents who are cold and detached.

Causation of Autism
Genetics. Several different genes appear to be involved in autism spectrum disorder. For some children, autism spectrum disorder can be associated with a genetic disorder, such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome. For other children, genetic changes (mutations) may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Still other genes may affect brain development or the way that brain cells communicate, or they may determine the severity of symptoms. Some genetic mutations seem to be inherited, while others occur spontaneously.
Environmental factors. Researchers are currently exploring whether factors such as viral infections, medications or complications during pregnancy, or air pollutants play a role in triggering autism spectrum disorder.
