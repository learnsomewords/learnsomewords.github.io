		<h2>Are Parents Good Teachers</h2>
		<p>
			Prarental influece tends to be of great benefit to children and more so during their early years and as they school.
			Of all the indivisuals involved in the upbringing of the Child, parents may not know but they daily behavious ranging from the manner in which they live,
			the tone they  use usually influences the manner in whih their children will act in the future.
		</p>
		<p>
			Students who have parents tend to be more involved in their school and they also have fewer behavioral problems. 
			Their academic performance is better as compared to the students whose parents are absent.
			The positivity of parents' influence can usually be demostrated during the elementary school and secondary levels.
			Based on the available research, when parents are more involved in the school life, their Children are likely to have a stromg performance since they are likely to make <span class="new">rectifications</span> in time and work collaboratively with teachers in encouraging the most acceptable classroom behavior.

			rectification: 	the act of offering an improvement to replace a mistake; setting right.
		</p>
		<p>
			This seemed to be a similar case to me when, during my first year in high school, my parents were never involved in my school life and my grades were poor. 
			However, the situation changed when they became concerned and more involved in my school life.
			In respect to these, my parents and teachers were able to identify at an appropriate time the various problems that were inhibiting my learning and the issues were resolved on time.
			Therefore, parents should always ensure that they have a positive influence on their Children.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the best ways in which parents can educate their children is by acting as their teachers as well as the most effective role model and by doing so; the children learn the various skills that they need. 
			Some of the skills that the children learn are the basic household tasks and handling of move complex responsibilities.
			when parents take their role seriously, they lay the groundwork for the children will have what is needed and know what is needed for them to develop into responsible and independent adults.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another way in which the parents educate their children is by modeling appropriate behavious.
			The manner in which parents behave and act has a great influence on how their children act in future, For exmaple, my parents is responsible nature molded me to be responsible like they.
		</p>
		<p>
			Parents have a role to play in their children's life and in relation to these, there are lessons that they should teach their kids is treating others with respect at all times and this plays an essential role in limiting conflicts among people since respect for the authority shows <span class="new">obedience</span>, respect for oneself usually shows self worth and self control. 
			I acquired this skill at an early age and still ensure that I follow it in my everyday activities.
		</p>
		<p class="new">
			Obedience: Obedience is behavior that's respectful and mindful of rules and laws. Parents, teachers, and cops all appreciate obedience. (the root of this word is obey?)
		</p>
		<p>
			Another lesson that parents should teach their kids is manners. This is because manners are said to raise a kid's social IQ and it also make them into being resonable and thoughtful people.
		</p>
		<p>
			The debate on whether parents are good teachers or not seems not to be ending soon since those against the arguments and those that are for it have strong contribution as well as influcence.
			There are aspects that we learn from our parents that tend to be more essential that what we learn from the teachers despite the long years of academic learning. 
			From our parents, we learn how best to talk, survive, and disdinguish what is right and wrong, <span class="new">morality</span> and life values. My parents taught me how to survive on my own at an early age. Even though they offered the required support, there were times where I was required to takle an issue my own. In most instances, children are usually true reflection of their parents and their characters are usually shaped by their parents and their characters are usually shaped by their parent's behavior and personality.
		</p>
		<p class="new">
			Morality: is a concern with whatâ€™s right or wrong. Your sense of morality prevents you from cheating on your school exams, on your taxes, or on your spouse.

		<h3>Comment:</h3>
		<p>
			In China we call this kind of essays 'High School Essays' because of the special evaluation system of the GaoKao (College Entrance Examination). In GaoKao, we advocate essays with good value and some personal experience examples or examples of other celebrities. This kind of essays is preferred in high school because of two reasons. First, it contains the so-called universally 'right' values. It is all about how to be a selfishness, good, kind, tolerant and nice doormat or talking about peace and love but focusing less or even never mentioning anything about the dark side of reality. The second thing is high school essays have more personal views and usually don't consider other people's opinion or the opposite opinion that much. This essay fit these two condition. This essay only gave examples about herself/himself. Things are based on his/her personal experience but may not fit everyone. And to be honest, the examples of a high school essay usually not strong enough because you can tell the truth but you can lie about your personal feeling about a certain thing. The feeling of the thing are not that convincable. Besides, it only focus on the good side of parents teaching but ignore the bad possibilities of it and it devalued other part of education which can also be a life-changing thing. Overall, this is a high school essay which can be a good practice material.
