	<p>I'm going to learn C++ because I found it is really important if I want to get into a big company. So I find a youtube video. I will try to figure out how things would work and what's the difference bettwen Java and C++. Why there are some people are saying Java is not suitable for making Games because of the garbage colleaction function. I know what is garbage collection but I don't know why it is related to make games. 
	There is the link of the video. I will take some notes here.
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y&t=111s">C++ tutorial</a>
	</p>
	<p>
	I downloaded the Code::Blocks IDE. An interesting thing is when you built and run there will be a system window actually run that C++ file. However, in Eclipse, it has a console to display the result. I don't really know why.

		<p>
			in C++ functions need to be decleared before they can be used
		</p>
		<p>
			the pointer is kind like the hash code in Java which is the memory adress
		</p>
		<p>
			you only need declartion and don't need creation when you create an object in C++
